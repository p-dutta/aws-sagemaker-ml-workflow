# Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker


## Steps Overview: 

- Step 1: Data staging
- Step 2: Model training and deployment
- Step 3: Lambdas and step function workflow
- Step 4: Testing and evaluation
- Step 5: Optional challenge
- Step 6: Cleanup cloud resources


In this project, I used AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. I deployed the model, used AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose my model and services into an event-driven application.
